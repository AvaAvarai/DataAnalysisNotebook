# Data Analysis Notebook

This data analysis notebook demonstrates lossless, lossy visualizations techinques, and classification methods. We demonstrate analysis of scientific data on hot-swappable datasets.  

Datasets supported are numeric tabular datasets with a 'class' column, .csv files provided in datasets folder. For testing purposes we focus on fisher_iris.csv, others included.  

The notebook is more easily viewed with a Jupyter viewer, web options include:

- [nbviewer](https://nbviewer.org/github/AvaAvarai/DataAnalysisNotebook/blob/main/data_analysis.ipynb)
